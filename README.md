# Three-component-models
This program is used to illustrate and compare the three-component models bulit in Sun, Brewin et al. (2023) for estimating size-fractionated phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST), as shown in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113415.

In this study, we developed one SST-independent model and two SST-dependent three-component models that quantifies the relationship between total Chl-a and Chl-a associated with the three PSCs (pico-, nano- and microplankton). The independent validation results indicate that the SST-dependent models have higher and similar accuracy in estimating PSCs, compared to the SST-independent model. The first SST-dependent model is with logistic functions (Brewin et al., 2017), which is referred to as the 16-parameter model. The second SST-dependent model is with quadratic polynomial function, two-term Gaussian function and logistic functions, which is referred to as the 17-parameter model.

The proposed ecological model, i.e., SST-dependent three-component models, will be at the centre of a new ocean-colour modelling framework, designed for investigating the response of phytoplankton to climate change, described in subsequent parts of this series of papers.
